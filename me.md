# #Me

"Know thyself", the only wisdom truly needed in this world. 

Reflecting on my self-reflection, it is tempting to call it disguised laziness, and further fuel self-loathing. But that would be a mistake. (Hey now, instead of judging myself constantly, an honest check-in touching all bases would likely be more useful.) 

To know what I am really like I can ask something similar sounding but perhaps easier to answer: 
### What do I really like?


At first glance, food and sex would be obvious answers, but do I really like them, or are they just justifications of a brain thinking whatever it has to, as means to an end? To test, consider if your enjoyment of food is proportional to your hunger at that moment, or your libido proportional to your hormonal levels. I thought I controlled what I like! This control is really an illusion, but that doesn't mean it is possible to live a consciously controlled life. It means whenever I think I am in control, I am mostly not. 

And it's not even necessary to be in control all the time. The ship is easily swayed by the movements of the sea, and slave to silent currents. If you were suddenly teleported to a ship in a stormy ocean, you may not know how to do it at first, but it is certainly possible to still make it through to wherever you want to go. Even a most basic sail and rudder will do, given enough 'skills'. So too in life, (though I am currently a hypocrite for saying it,) it is possible to reach towards the farthest of dreams with simple thinking tools used well, even if you don't know how the ship is moving in the immediate vicinity. 

### What do I really want?
Bah what a mess. Edit this shit .. You need clarity. What are you trying to say?

I don't know who I am, or is it just a feeling and not the 'truth'? Since truths are often two-sided.. 

If what I feel is a function of circumstance and perspective, I can optimize it by parts. Circumstance is limited by our biologically limited (to _reality_,) cognition and awareness, which in turn limits the subjective dimensions along which we measure our world and surroundings. We can only describe in words we know, when we feel in terms of what we have felt before. By knowing more, we can see things we have missed, but there will always be things beyond the horizon until we are God. Perspective can be optimized by adopting the attitude which maximises survival and well-being.

## Wait, start from scratch. What's this about?

### Who am i?

.. .. .. I don't like that this question is so easily answered, without acknowledgement of the fact that no answer will ever be complete. I like that you ask it.

### What am i?

#1. Physically, or in terms of science, a biological organism.
This explanation would provide a mechanistic view, breaking everything into so many pieces that it becomes a serious chore to keep track of it all. Each piece in turn is made of Different Things when observed closely enough. Deep down it's all just squiggly somethings.. __is-es and is-nots__. As they are grouped in different amounts into different things, the combinatorics create a range of Different Things. Those Different Things combine in Different Ways to form even more Different Things. Quarks form sub-atomic particles which form molecules which form materials which form tissue etc.. Things dance among themselves on various levels, and we started asking why, and someone said "forces." 


#2. Colloquially, or in terms of common words, a self-happening.
Quarks form sub-atomic particles which form molecules which form materials which form tissue etc.. Things dance among themselves on various levels, and we started asking why, and someone said "forces." (Many seem to have stopped asking why because it is not in their job description ..  and it would make sense too, society wouldn't function if people were standing around waiting for why).

*But now it seems we should stand around and ask why rather than continue doing what we're doing.. We don't know why because we have to dig into it, and at the same time, build from what we find.*

Forces would be undetectable were it not for the things they act on, so really you could say the things are inseparable from the forces. That would imply they are really not even separate things, as the separate things are tied together by the forces that act on them and it's all really the same thing. I am a thing in one tiny pocket of this humungous Happening. I am a section of this Happening that can recognize itself, and other happenings as things. I seem to be surrounded by other happenings like me that can Recognize things, and it seems recognition is just a special case of things being able to make themselves. We are Things that make more things, happenings that make happen more happenings.


### Where am I?
I am a thing in one tiny pocket of this humungous Happening. I am a section of this Happening that can recognize itself, and other happenings as things. I seem to be surrounded by other happenings like me that can Recognize things, and it seems recognition is just a special case of things being able to make themselves. There other regions of this humungous Happening which are things that can make themselves, they don't seem to do it in a way that is Recognizing though. 

This place we call the Universe is, in a way, a place where things happen the way they have always happened, and at the same time no one happening happens twice, thanks to the way time happens to us. What is most spectacular is that, perhaps along with the ability to Recognize ourselves, we have also obtained power and unlocked the mental realm by controlling happenings that always happen in predictable ways so that they combine to happen in a way that hasn't happened before. We are Things that make more things, happenings that make happen more happenings.

We're on a floating rock, which is a super interesting place with such a massive variety of happenings and different things. (*As compared to other places where happenings are of lesser density and higher intensity, as far as we reognise. Like stars and black holes. It might also be because our power of Recognising is kinda short-ranged in higher resolutions.*) 

### What am i doing?
Other than what everyone else is doing? Other than surviving? (Or, in more comfortable circumstances, other than being a '_someone_' with the accomplishment of my personal dreams?)``
